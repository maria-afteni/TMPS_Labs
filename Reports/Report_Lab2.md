## Objectives:
&ensp; &ensp;
__1. Study and understand the Creational Design Patterns.__

&ensp; &ensp;
__2. Choose a domain, define its main classes/models/entities and choose the appropriate instantiation mechanisms.__

&ensp; &ensp;
__3. Use some creational design patterns for object instantiation in a sample project.__


## Theory:
Creational design patterns are a specific category of design patterns that primarily deal with the process of creating 
objects. They provide solutions to manage and control object creation, enabling developers to create objects in a more 
organized and efficient manner. Some well-known creational patterns include Singleton, Factory, and Prototype, each 
serving different purposes in object creation and management.
